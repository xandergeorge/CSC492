            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>WriteAble is a web-based, accessibility-focused document checker designed to help users create clearer, 
            more inclusive written content. The system analyzes user-submitted text for grammar, readability, and accessibility issues,
            then presents feedback in organized categories with plain-language explanations and actionable suggestions. 
            Unlike traditional document checkers, WriteAble emphasizes education by explaining why certain writing choices may create barriers and how to improve them.
            Intended for students, faculty, professionals, and content creators, the project is scoped to be completed within a seven-week development cycle and prioritizes usability,
            accessibility, and compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards while remaining lightweight and easy to maintain.</p>
