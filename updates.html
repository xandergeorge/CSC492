        <h2>Week 1: Foundation & Frameworks </h2>
        <h5>February 4, 2026</h5>
        <p>We are officially off to the races with <strong>WriteAble</strong>. This week was focused on transitioning from a high-level concept to a concrete technical plan. The biggest milestone this week was the submission of our Software Requirements Specification draft. Getting this draft turned in ensures that the whole team is aligned on exactly what we are building before diving deeper in.</p><p>While the backend is where the magic happens, we know that accessibility starts with a clear user interface. We have begun developing a potential landing page for the project. This will eventually serve as the primary portal for users to upload documents and view their accessibility scores.</p>
        <p>Finally, we spent time mapping out our user journey. We asked ourselves: <em>What does the experience look like for a user who has never audited a document for accessibility?</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upload:</strong> A seamless drag-and-drop interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Feedback as the program parses headers, alt-text, contrast ratios, and more!</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Clear, actionable steps to fix identified issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Week 2: Finalizing Plans & Project Direction</h2>
        <h5>February 11, 2026</h5>
        <p>This week we wrapped up and finalized our Software Requirements Specification document, which gave us a clear plan for what <strong>WriteAble</strong> will include and how we want to build it. After finishing that, we worked on two new drafts: an initial press release and a preliminary project schedule. Writing the press release helped us explain the purpose of <strong>WriteAble</strong> in a simple way for others to understand, while the project schedule helped us organize our timeline and upcoming tasks. Overall, this week was focused on planning ahead and making sure our team is prepared for the next stages of development.</p>

        <h2>Week 3: Final Revisions + Interface</h2>
        <h5>February 18, 2026</h5>
        <p>This week our team finalized revisions to our project schedule and our press release. We updated the timeline and made sure our goals and deadlines were clear. We also finalized the press release so it better explains the purpose of our project. In addition to finishing those updates, we started building the first version of the <strong>WriteAble</strong> interface. It feels good to move from planning into actually creating the project.</p>
