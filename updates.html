        <h2>Week 1: Foundation & Frameworks </h2>
        <h5>Febuary 4, 2026</h5>
        <p>We are officially off to the races with <strong>WriteAble</strong>. This week was focused on transitioning from a high-level concept to a concrete technical plan. The biggest milestone this week was the submission of our Software Requirements Specification draft. Getting this draft turned in ensures that the whole team is aligned on exactly what we are building before diving deeper in.</p><p>While the backend is where the magic happens, we know that accessibility starts with a clear user interface. We have begun developing a potential landing page for the project. This will eventually serve as the primary portal for users to upload documents and view their accessibility scores.</p>
        <p>Finally, we spent time mapping out our user journey. We asked ourselves: <em>What does the experience look like for a user who has never audited a document for accessibility?</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upload:</strong> A seamless drag-and-drop interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Feedback as the program parses headers, alt-text, contrast ratios, and more!</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Clear, actionable steps to fix identified issues.</li>
        </ul>
